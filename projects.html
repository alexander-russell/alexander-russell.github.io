                    Recommends you a cocktail! You select your favourite cocktail, what ingredients you have on hand and
                    how many new ones you'd be willing to buy. The application then gives you a handful of
                    recommendations based on that information, and lists out the ingredients for each one.

                    The data comes from #TidyTuesday, and my analysis is heavily inspired by Julia Silge's demonstration
                    of tidymodels using this dataset. I modelled the data with UMAP, and used that to determine
                    similarity of cocktails. For a selected cocktail, the application calculates the euclidean distance
                    between that and all other cocktails in the dataset, using the 2D UMAP space.

                    With the list of ingredients available, I also set it up to filter out any that need heaps of new
                    ingredients, letting the user determine what constitutes heaps.

                    I've been keeping track of my recipes in a JSON file for a while, and I recently put together a web
                    layout for the data. I've added a couple of features that I think are pretty cool: cost per serve
                    calculation, scalable ingredients and preset timers. The whole thing is hand-coded by me.
                </p>
                <p class="more">
                    To create a recipe entry, I've written a PowerShell script that prompts for each field and assembles
                    them into a custom [recipe] class before serialising to JSON. One of the class methods calculates
                    the cost per serve of the recipe. To write this I had to write an algorithm to convert between the
                    different units I used in my recipes, and I had to run through Aldi with a spreadsheet.
                </p>
                <p class="more">
                    The PowerShell interface also lets me add timers to the recipe, by giving each a name and a duration
                    in seconds. When I render the website, the JavaScript creates an element for each timer. A single
                    click starts/stops the timer, a double click resets it. My favourite part is that thanks to modern
                    web technology etc, it was trivial to incorporate text-to-speech - instead of ringing, the timer
                    repeats its name over and over again until you reset the timer.
